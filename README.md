# ssh-client
Bastille Template to create an ssh client Jail for security uses

 STATUS:  Testing


This jail has the following utilities installed by default:

	OpenSSH-askpass
	autossh
	clusterssh
	openssh-portable
	ssh-vault
	sudo
	terminator
	screen
	passwordsafe
  knock

These should be a good base for using ssh to connect securely to remote systems.
